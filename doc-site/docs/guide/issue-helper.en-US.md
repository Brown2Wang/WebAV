# Issue Helper

You should view creating an issue as a contribution to the community, not just a way for project maintainers to help you solve problems.
Therefore, when submitting an issue for the first time, please carefully read How to Ask Questions.

The community welcomes well-crafted issues that help make the project more robust and stable, but issues that clearly do not meet the standards may be closed immediately.
