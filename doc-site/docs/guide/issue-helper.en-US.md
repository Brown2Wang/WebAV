# Issue Helper

## Before you begin...

The Issue List is used to track bug reports and feature requests, and does not accept usage related issues. Issues that do not meet the requirements will be closed immediately.

For usage related questions, the following steps can be taken:

- Read the introduction and component documentation.
- Search for questions in FAQs and changelog.
- Find/ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/bilibili/WebAV/discussions).

## Questioning Skills

- Do your best to solve the problem before you ask it, including checking the Issues list, searching for information, and debugging your code.
- If creating an Issue, it should be noted that it is different from the chat question mode. It should be written, concise and accurate, and provide detailed context once and for all to avoid questioning.

## Questions To Ask

- Describe the problem completely. Patterns: What features were implemented in what scenarios, and what problems were encountered along the way?
  - The first "what" is the environment (context) information, the second "what" is the purpose, and the third "what" is the real question.
  - A typical mistake is to describe your solution and then ask how to implement it.
- Summarize efforts and information gained.
- Make the question easy to answer from the perspective of the respondent.

## Reporting Bugs

- Provide reproduction steps, preferably with a reproducible project (e.g. codesandbox, stackblitz, new project created from the official DEMO code).
- Focus on describing the difference between expected and actual results.
- Explain the verification actions done and the intelligence gathered.
- Provides contextual information such as operating system, browser, WebAV version, etc.
