# Issue Helper

You should regard submitting an Issue as **a contribution to the community**;  
Therefore, for your first Issue submission, be sure to carefully read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](https://github.com/bilibili/WebAV/issues/60).

The community welcomes high-quality Issues to make the project more mature and stable, but Issues that clearly do not meet the standards may be closed immediately.
